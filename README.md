# Software Versioning and Configuration Management Tool
This project is built around the requirement of transparency for current and past software  versions and configurations. New UNECE standards which come into effect towards 2025 will require auto-manufactuers to record all software versions and configurations that were used during the testing of a vehicle.

# The Goal
The goal of this project is for users to request software versions and set configurations using the online form which will then be executed through a live Ansible runner.
